Use Notifications for mundane worldbuilding stuff. What's going on in the world that isn't mission-critical, but sets the tone? Birds chirping, the sun glistening through the trees, etc. Can occasionally have things happen here that unlock important stuff, but use that as a tool sparingly.

Make a second location, and a quest from the mayor to go there. This should be a good place to introduce a very basic encounter system through the event system. Just kick off the "choose random event for this area" stuff with a button click that says "Wander around" or whatever.

DONE Make a really basic weather system using the Engine's setTimeout delay system. Just set up a delay time range, then call the setTimeout button with a function that picks from possible weather states and sets it accordingly. Can have minor stat impacts, but it would also be cool to have a minimal interface animation to represent the weather, like some dashed lines for rain or snowflakes falling or whatever. Could even change the background color a bit near the top of the screen to emphasize the change. Call "setWeather" in location's onArrival function using the availableWeather array that should exist on every location. If no availableWeather, default to sunny.

DONE, NOT TESTED If the weather callback is still in-flight after location has changed, don't do a weather change. The easiest way to handle this is probably to send the current location with the callback, and if it no longer matches current location when it actually fires, then just skip it. This avoids the issue of going somewhere with a different set of possible weather conditions and having the callback throw an impossible weather condition into the mix.

It would be cool to create stat changes based on weather. Like, speed decreasing in the snow, perception decreasing in clouds (and worse in rain), etc. Do a basic example of this with the perception example. This will necessitate a method to derive Character stats anew with each character stat change, so create a handleStateChange method in Character and make it work based on a second set of values. For example, character.stats.tempChanges. This state variable will need to know what provided the stat change so that it can be removed or altered when that thing changes.

Add a way to interact with inventory objects. We need to be able to read that book, or at the very least figure out that it's too hard to read.

The ::before element on the Stores area not being animateable via JQuery makes the background color changes look kinda janky. Maybe figure out a better way to do that title effect so that it can be animated smoothly.

Create scripts for Outpost and Road to Outpost, and init them in the Mayor's quest acceptance thing.

Eventually there will be too many tabs to manage cleanly. I think tabs should be grouped under like, Locales of some description. We'd need to do a load step sorta like how the Engine checks for init conditions for the locations, but do it based on a Locale, so like, the village, the outpost, etc. are all in "The Northern Shore", but if you want to go further, you'll need to do something to change Locales, and then that'll load a whole new set of tabs and stuff. We could also bring weather out to the Locale level, instead of the Location level, and then only initiate new weather for Locations that need it for specific purposes.

Could make a simple "Equipment" inventory in the Stores section. Click an item to use or equip it, Equipment is in a separate section from general items, and Equipment pieces have knowledge of what slot they fill. Probably better to do something more flexible with the inventory in State Manager than ('inventory.blah', 1). Inventory items should be complex objects, and if they have a 'slot' field then they get filtered into the Equipment section. Equipment items that can also be used can open a modal (one like the Event panel, probably, rather than figuring out a popover menu at the chosen item) to choose whether to use or equip it. If an item is destroyed on use, we might add a tiny bit of friction in case of misclicks. Probably more interesting to the player to always pop up a modal with information about the item, and then have a "Use" button to make sure that's what they want to do. That way it doesn't only warn for items that will disappear, which would give the player too much meta-knowledge.

It might be cool to make an item start out with a generic name, and get a new name and functionality when the player clicks it. Like, 'a knife wrapped in cloth' can be used, and in doing so becomes 'a silver knife', which can be equipped. This *could* be used to create some loot-boxy sort of drive in players, but I'd rather it just be more about the feeling of getting an item and then realizing what it is after you do some additional investigating. For a different example, 'Weird book' becomes 'A Comprehensive History of Chadtopia'. Equipment could also have hidden properties that are revealed through equipping or using them via an 'onEquip' function, which would add the hidden properties to the item. Could also have a more generic 'isVisible' function that will keep the effects functioning without showing them to the player until something happens to make that effect known.

Anchor stores area to character area so it doesn't slide away.

Wandering on roads should eventually unlock the way forward, and wandering in other places should occasionally unlock new stuff. There should be an event flag to keep that from happening on the first several adventures there, either via a "times adventured here" counter or something more clever than that.
