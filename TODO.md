Use Notifications for mundane worldbuilding stuff. What's going on in the world that isn't mission-critical, but sets the tone? Birds chirping, the sun glistening through the trees, etc. Can occasionally have things happen here that unlock important stuff, but use that as a tool sparingly.

Make a second location, and a quest from the mayor to go there. This should be a good place to introduce a very basic encounter system through the event system. Just kick off the "choose random event for this area" stuff with a button click that says "Wander around" or whatever.

DONE Make a really basic weather system using the Engine's setTimeout delay system. Just set up a delay time range, then call the setTimeout button with a function that picks from possible weather states and sets it accordingly. Can have minor stat impacts, but it would also be cool to have a minimal interface animation to represent the weather, like some dashed lines for rain or snowflakes falling or whatever. Could even change the background color a bit near the top of the screen to emphasize the change. Call "setWeather" in location's onArrival function using the availableWeather array that should exist on every location. If no availableWeather, default to sunny.

DONE, NOT TESTED If the weather callback is still in-flight after location has changed, don't do a weather change. The easiest way to handle this is probably to send the current location with the callback, and if it no longer matches current location when it actually fires, then just skip it. This avoids the issue of going somewhere with a different set of possible weather conditions and having the callback throw an impossible weather condition into the mix.

It would be cool to create stat changes based on weather. Like, speed decreasing in the snow, perception decreasing in clouds (and worse in rain), etc. Do a basic example of this with the perception example. This will necessitate a method to derive Character stats anew with each character stat change, so create a handleStateChange method in Character and make it work based on a second set of values. For example, character.stats.tempChanges. This state variable will need to know what provided the stat change so that it can be removed or altered when that thing changes.
